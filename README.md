Splunk, a powerful security information and event management (SIEM) platform, would be used to collect, index, and analyze security logs from various sources, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and servers. By correlating these logs, the analyst can identify anomalies, detect potential attacks, and proactively respond to threats. Additionally, Splunk can be used to generate reports on security trends and compliance, aiding in risk management and regulatory adherence.
